# SaferNet

SaferNet is an AI-powered, real-time domain and URL validation platform designed to enhance web safety for users and organizations. With a robust API built on FastAPI, SaferNet applies machine learning to accurately classify internet domains as safe or malicious, supporting both automated and manual threat management.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **AI-Driven Domain/URL Classification**  
  Leverages a machine learning pipeline to analyze features such as WHOIS data, IP geolocation, TLD analysis, and complex URL structures to predict and flag potentially harmful sites.

- **RESTful API Endpoints**  
  Provides an easy-to-use API for:
  - Domain/URL safety prediction
  - Blacklist, whitelist, and regex-list management
  - Domain status queries and list updates

- **Dynamic & Automated List Management**  
  Keeps up-to-date blacklists and whitelists, with the ability to programmatically add, check, and retrieve domains for rapid incident response.

- **Advanced Feature Extraction**  
  Uses DNS/IP lookups, WHOIS queries, string analysis, geocoding, and more to create a comprehensive risk profile for each domain or URL.

- **Extensible Architecture**  
  Modular Python scripts allow for easy integration of new validation techniques, third-party tools like Pi-Hole, and further AI modules.

## 🔍 Usage

### **API Endpoints**

| Endpoint                               | Method | Description                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `/predict`                             | POST   | Predicts if a given domain/URL is safe       |
| `/blacklist/add`                       | POST   | Add a domain/URL to the blacklist            |
| `/whitelist/add`                       | POST   | Add a safe domain/URL to whitelist           |
| `/check/{domain}`                      | GET    | Check status (blacklist/whitelist) of domain |
| `/blacklist` / `/whitelist` / `/regex` | GET    | Retrieve lists of current entries            |

> Example payloads and tested responses can be found in the `SafeNetAI.ipynb` notebook.

### **AI Model**

* The app loads `model.pkl` (a scikit-learn serialized model) for URL/domain inference.
* **Feature extraction** is handled automatically—see `app/api/domain_validator/scripts/predict/feature_extractions.py`.

## 🤖 Extendability

* **Pi-Hole Support:** Integration modules available for local DNS-level blocking.
* **Add Your Own Model:** Replace `model.pkl` and update `ai.py` for custom ML pipelines.
* **Plug-in Scripts:** Easily add new endpoints or validation logic in the `scripts/` directory.
